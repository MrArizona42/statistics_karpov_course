In this repository I store my study projects with statistical test.

You can find here:
- tests on numerical target: t-test, ANOVA, Regression analysis
- tests on categorical target: Chi-Squared, Fisher's exact
- tests for normality
- tests for equality of Variance

The repository is constantly being improved. Coming soon: cluster analysis, bootstrap
